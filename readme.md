# IMDB Poster Grabber
Grab movie poster images from IMDB based on their IMDB codes.

## Usage
Put IMDB codes (from URLs) in `imdb_codes.txt`. Then run:

```bash
python grabber.py
```

All found posters will appear in `posters`.
You will be prompted for whether you want to select the posters to keep.
If you choose not to, all posters will be left so you can pick them yourself.
